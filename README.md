# Apple-Map
I show you guys how to let the user enter a location they want to go and then map out a route from there current location. Basically making a GPS / Directions App.   We start off by setting up the view which includes a map view, text field, and a button. From there we link it up. After that we get the address from the text field and pass it to a function that will return the long and lat. After that we get the long and lat of the current users location. Pass it into a function with the long and lat of where they want to go. From there we are able to send in a map request that will provide us the route and we are able to map it out.
